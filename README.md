This GitHub repository contains the code for the individual assignment of IoT Algorithms and Services.
The project is composed by the following parts:

1. Signal Generation code
2. Code for the ESP32 to sample the signal, adjust the frequency and send messages.
3. Arduino code for a ESP8266 to measure the power used by the ESP32 while sampling.
4. Some evaluations over the power consumtions based on the sampling frequency

## How to execute the project

The first step needed is to generate a signal, in this project signal is generated by a python script as audio output.
