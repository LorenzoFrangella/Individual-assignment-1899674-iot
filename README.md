This GitHub repository contains the code for the individual assignment of IoT Algorithms and Services.
The project is composed by the following parts:

1. Signal Generation code
2. Code for the ESP32 to sample the signal, adjust the frequency and send messages.
3. Arduino code for a ESP8266 to measure the power used by the ESP32 while sampling.
4. Some evaluations over the power consumtions based on the sampling frequency

## How to execute the project

#### Signal Generation

The first step needed is to generate a signal, in this project signal is generated by a python script as audio output.
With that script is possible to generate a signal as a sum of multiple sinusoid functions given by the formula:
$$\sum_{k=1}^n a_k sin(2\pi t f_k+ \phi_k)$$
Below an example of a signal generated with the sum of the following sinusoids:

    a = [7,8,5]     f = [2,6,10]    phase = [0.6,0,0.2]

Once the signal is generated it is played from the pc, and thanks to a [circuit](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/how-to-read-data-from-audio-jack/458301/3) the signal can be passed to a GPIO pin
of the ESP32 where is possible to sample (an ADC pin).

#### Signal Sampling
The code for the ESP32 can be found in the folder "esp-code" wich is structured as the following.

    esp-code
        |
        |->main
            | -> main.c         ---->   File containing the code executed on startup 
            | -> fft_config.h   ---->   File to setup the fft
            | -> mqtt.h         ---->   File to use mqtt
            | -> sampling.h     ---->   File for sampling task
            | -> sender.h       ---->   File for sampling task
            | -> structs.h      ---->   Data structures to pass arguments to tasks
            | -> wifi.h         ---->   File to use wifi

Code can be built and flashed in the esp by entering in the folder "eps-code" and run

    idf.py build flash monitor

To setup the parameters needed to make the project run is necessary to enter into menuconfig, 
in the menu Sampling configuration and set
